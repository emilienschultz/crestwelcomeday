## Digital practices at CREST


<!-- 
- conducted a survey this summer to know a bit better what's going on at CREST
- Digital culture is strong but diverse
- There is room to improve best practices, for instance regarding reproducibility and open science
-->

[Results survey july-september 2024, N=81](https://emilienschultz.github.io/survey-software-crest/)

- A diversity of practices, but
- <span class="numbers">99%</span> of the respondents are using numeric data
- <span class="numbers">49%</span> considers that reproducibility of computational results is important for their work
- <span class="numbers">41%</span> are involved in open source/open science pratices

<span class="numbers">CREST, a data driven lab ?</span>

## Insights of CREST Data Lab
<!--

- At GENES, there is a ongoing dynamic to offer collective ressources to support research
- First, it means a data lab with the onyxia infrastructure
- Second, it means several expanding ressources such as available software and storing capacity
- Third, it means organizing training sessions
-->

- **GENES Digital Department** deploys shared infrastructures
- Currently and in the coming years:
  - **[GENES DataLab Onyxia](https://onyxia.lab.groupe-genes.fr/)**
  - Secured data storage solutions
  - Dedicated research resources (e.g., GPUs)
- Training sessions during the year




## Digital Skills for PhD Students

<!--
- With Nicolas Chopin in statistics, we organize a dedicated training session for PhD student early november
- It will be focused on basic digital skills for research
- Stay tunned for more information
-->

[**November 6th, afternoon** (*mail soon*)](https://crest.science/event/digital-skills-for-crest-phd-students/)

- “*Don’t be afraid of the command line interface*”: a gentle introduction to CLI
- *Learning from open-source practices to improve open science*: introduction to code versioning tools (Git & Github) 
- “*Separate the content from form*”: introduction and discussion on best Latex practices for research to format scientific articles


<span class="numbers">We would like to hear what training you would need</span>



## What is the Onyxa Datalab ?

<!--

- Before leaving you, for those who don't know, i want to show you the Onyxia datalab
- What if I want to continue the analysis of the previous survey and to send the notebook to a colleague to make some tests ?
-->

<span class="numbers">A quick demo<span>

- Launch a dedicated Jupyter Lab service at [https://onyxia.lab.groupe-genes.fr/](https://onyxia.lab.groupe-genes.fr/)
